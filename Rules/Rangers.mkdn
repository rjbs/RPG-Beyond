# Ranger

Rangers are masters of the outdoors, patrolling and protecting large stretches
of wilderness from evil humanoids and monsters. Rangers often take on the role
of spy, scout and the first line of defense for more civilized and settled
areas. They are well-versed in combat and survival in wilderness settings.

## Requirements and Restrictions

Rangers use eight-sided dice (d8) to determine their hit points and standard
weapon damage.

Rangers may use any weapons and armor, but they can not use their unique
ranger abilities when wearing heavier than chain mail.

## Special Abilities

Rangers use the 2d6 Thief Skills table for the following skills, of which they
choose one as their favored skill.

### Tracking

Familiar with the signs left by humans, humanoids and various other creatures
as they make their way through the wilderness, rangers can discover and follow
the trail of those they are pursuing â€“ sometimes even in the worst of
conditions.

### Move Silently

(as thief skill)

### Hide in Wilderness

(as thief skill "Hide in Shadows")

### Wilderness Survival

Rangers learn how to live off of the land and survive even the harshest natural
environments. If a ranger spends at least six hours a day gathering food and
supplies (hunting, fishing, gathering fruits, berries, firewood, setting up a
camp, etc.) they can keep a party of up to six adventures alive and well.

### Direction Sense

When traveling from a known location through natural terrain, Rangers do not
get lost.
