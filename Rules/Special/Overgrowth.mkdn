# Heretical Overgrowth Rules

## Overview

Heresy weed is an extraordinary plant cultivated mostly by wizards, arcanists,
and other such troublemakers.  If carefully tended, it can survive and even
flourish for many seasons, but will eventually die off, and it never produces
seed.  It can, however, be transplanted into the living body of any creature
with a soul, and can live there indefinitely.  After an extended period in a
host body, it can even be used to take cuttings.

The effects of a heresy weed implantation are complex.  They are dangerous but
not *entirely* harmful to the host.  The heresy weed can impart improved
physical and mental prowess, accelerate healing, and even bring the host back
from apparent death.  On the other hand, it can have strange effects on the
host's judgement and priorities, can cause fits of somnambulism and lost time,
and even permanent insanity.  Reports of stranger side effects exist, but are
neither uniform nor well documented.

## System

A character has a pool of temporary Wisdom points.  The maximum number of
points in the pool, and its starting value, is the character's permanent Wisdom
score.

* The player may spend one temporary Wisdom point to regain one hit point, no
  more than one per combat round.

* The player may spend one permanent Wisdom point to increase their Strength,
  Dexterity, Constitution, or Intelligence by one.

* The player may spend two permanent Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, or
  Intelligence points to increase their Wisdom by one.  (This must be two
  points in a single ability.  Mixing and matching is not allowed.)

* When the character sleeps more than a few hours at a stretch, they must save
  versus spells (+6) or somnambulate.

* For every two continuous hours of sleep, the character regains one temporary
  Wisdom point.

* When the character's temporary Wisdom pool is reduced to zero, the character
  loses one permanent point of Wisdom and gains one Derangement.

* When the character's permanent Wisdom is reduced to zeroâ€¦
